# Aboutfy
Aboutfy is a React Web App that consumes Spotify API and shows the user's musical preferences.\

The backend OAuth server was provided by [Mattias Johansson](https://github.com/mpj) and you
can find it [here](https://github.com/mpj/oauth-bridge-template).

## Executing locally
You are able to run this project locally on your machine, despite **the only screen that you will be able to access
is the login page**, you won't be allowed to actually login in spotify and see the whole application working.
For doing so, just execute this on the terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/casteluc/aboutfy.git
cd aboutfy
npm install
npm start
```
